  #|! This function sets an input mode option for the specified window. The
  |  mode must be one of `GLFW_CURSOR`, `GLFW_STICKY_KEYS` or
  |  `GLFW_STICKY_MOUSE_BUTTONS`.
  |
  |  If the mode is GLFW_CURSOR, the value must be one of the following cursor
  |  modes:
  |   * `GLFW_CURSOR_NORMAL` makes the cursor visible and behaving normally.
  |   * `GLFW_CURSOR_HIDDEN` makes the cursor invisible when it is over the
  |     client area of the window but does not restrict the cursor from leaving.
  |   * `GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED` hides and grabs the cursor, providing virtual
  |     and unlimited cursor movement. This is useful for implementing for
  |     example 3D camera controls.
  |
  |  If the mode is `GLFW_STICKY_KEYS`, the value must be either `GLFW_TRUE`
  |  to enable sticky keys, or `GLFW_FALSE` to disable it. If sticky keys are
  |  enabled, a key press will ensure that `glfw-get-key` returns `GLFW_PRESS`
  |  the next time it is called even if the key had been released before the
  |  call. This is useful when you are only interested in whether keys have
  |  been pressed but not when or in which order.
  |
  |  If the mode is `GLFW_STICKY_MOUSE_BUTTONS`, the value must be either
  |  `GLFW_TRUE` to enable sticky mouse buttons, or `GLFW_FALSE` to disable
  |  it. If sticky mouse buttons are enabled, a mouse button press will
  |  ensure that glfwGetMouseButton returns GLFW_PRESS the next time it is
  |  called even if the mouse button had been released before the call. This
  |  is useful when you are only interested in whether mouse buttons have been
  |  pressed but not when or in which order.

  #| Callback setters ====================================================== |#
  #|! Set the callback function in case of an error.
  |
  | cb:lambda (err:int msg:string) -> void
  |#
  (define (glfw-set-error-callback cb)
    ((foreign-procedure "glfwSetErrorCallback" (uptr) void)
     (callback cb (int string) void)))

  #|! Set the callback function for window close event. This callback is called
  |  when a user attempts to close the window from the window manager.
  |  If the function is to prevent this from happening it should call
  |  `(set-window-should-close #f)`
  |
  | window: ptr
  | cb:     lambda (window:ptr) -> void
  |#
  (define (glfw-set-window-close-callback window cb)

  #|! Set the callback function for keyboard events.
  |
  | window: ptr
  | cb:     lambda (window:ptr key:int scancode:int action:int mods:int) -> void
  |#
  (define (glfw-set-key-callback window cb)
    ((foreign-procedure "glfwSetKeyCallback" (uptr uptr) uptr)
     window (callback cb (uptr int int int int) void)))

  #|! This is the function signature for framebuffer resize callback functions.
  |
  | window: ptr
  | cb:     lambda (window:ptr width:int height:int)
  |#
  (define (glfw-set-framebuffer-size-callback window cb)
    ((foreign-procedure "glfwSetFramebufferSizeCallback" (uptr uptr) uptr)
     window (callback cb (uptr int int) void)))

  #|! This function sets the character callback of the specified window, which
  |  is called when a Unicode character is input.
  |
  |  The character callback is intended for Unicode text input. As it deals
  |  with characters, it is keyboard layout dependent, whereas the key
  |  callback is not.  Characters do not map 1:1 to physical keys, as a key
  |  may produce zero, one or more characters. If you want to know whether a
  |  specific physical key was pressed or released, see the key callback
  |  instead.
  |
  |  The character callback behaves as system text input normally does and
  |  will not be called if modifier keys are held down that would prevent
  |  normal text input on that platform, for example a Super (Command) key on
  |  OS X or Alt key on Windows. There is a character with modifiers callback
  |  that receives these events.
  |
  | window: ptr
  | cb:     lambda (window:ptr codepoint:unsigned-32)
  | ->:     ptr
  |     Previous handler, but actually the FFI packed one.

  #| Timing ================================================================ |#
  #|! This function returns the value of the GLFW timer. Unless the timer has
  |  been set using `glfw-set-time`, the timer measures time elapsed since
  |  GLFW was initialized.
  |
  |  The resolution of the timer is system dependent, but is usually on the
  |  order of a few micro- or nanoseconds. It uses the highest-resolution
  |  monotonic time source on each supported platform.
  |
  | ->: double
  |     Current time in seconds.
  |#
  (define glfw-get-time
    (foreign-procedure "glfwGetTime" () double))

  #|! Set the GLFW time. It then continues to count up from that value.
  |  The value must be a positive finite number less than or equal to
  |  18446744073.0, which is approximately 584.5 years.
  |
  | time: double
  |#
  (define glfw-set-time

  #| Monitors ============================================================== |#

    (foreign-procedure "glfwGetPrimaryMonitor" () uptr))

  (define glfw-get-video-mode
    (foreign-procedure "glfwGetVideoMode" (uptr) (* glfw-vid-mode)))

  #| Windowing ============================================================= |#
  #|! This function creates a window and its associated OpenGL or OpenGL ES
  |  context. Most of the options controlling how the window and its context
  |  should be created are specified with window hints.
  |
  | width:   int
  | height:  int
  | title:   string
  | monitor: ptr
  |     Monitor to use for full-screen mode, NULL will give windowed mode.
  | window:  ptr
  |     Window to share resources with. Usually just NULL.
  | ->: ptr
  |#
  (define glfw-create-window
    (foreign-procedure "glfwCreateWindow" (int int string uptr uptr) uptr))

  #|! This function destroys the specified window and its context. On calling
  |  this function, no further callbacks will be called for that window.
  |
  |  If the context of the specified window is current on the main thread, it is
  |  detached before being destroyed.
  |
  | window: ptr
  |#
  (define glfw-destroy-window

  #| Event polling ========================================================= |#
  (define glfw-poll-events
    (foreign-procedure "glfwPollEvents" () void))

  (define glfw-wait-events
    (foreign-procedure "glfwWaitEvents" () void))

  #|! This function puts the calling thread to sleep until at least one event
  |  is available in the event queue, or until the specified timeout is
  |  reached. If one or more events are available, it behaves exactly like
  |  `glfw-poll-events`, i.e. the events in the queue are processed and the
  |  function then returns immediately. Processing events will cause the
  |  window and input callbacks associated with those events to be called.
  |
  | timeout: double
  |     Timeout in seconds.
  |#
  (define glfw-wait-events-timeout
    (foreign-procedure "glfwWaitEventsTimeout" (double) void))

  #| And all the rest ====================================================== |#
  (define glfw-make-context-current
    (foreign-procedure "glfwMakeContextCurrent" (uptr) void))

  (define glfw-swap-buffers
    (foreign-procedure "glfwSwapBuffers" (uptr) void))

  #|! This function sets the swap interval for the current OpenGL or OpenGL ES
  |  context, i.e. the number of screen updates to wait from the time
  |  `glfw-swap-buffers` was called before swapping the buffers and returning.
  |  This is sometimes called vertical synchronization, vertical retrace
  |  synchronization or just vsync.
  |
  | interval: int
  |     The minimum number of screen updates to wait for until the buffers are
  |     swapped by `glfw-swap-buffers`.
  |#
  (define glfw-swap-interval
    (foreign-procedure "glfwSwapInterval" (int) void))

  #| GL loader ============================================================= |#
  #|! This function returns the address of the specified OpenGL or OpenGL ES
  |  core or extension function, if it is supported by the current context.
  |  A context must be current on the calling thread. Calling this function
  |  without a current context will cause a GLFW_NO_CURRENT_CONTEXT error.
  |#
  (define glfw-get-proc-address
    (foreign-procedure "glfwGetProcAddress" (string) uptr))

  (define glfw-extension-supported
    (foreign-procedure "glfwExtensionSupported" (string) int))

  (define glfw-get-required-instance-extensions
